Neopixel Controllers
====================

Various Neopixel-style LED strip controllers based on the ATtiny85 microcontroller. Due to their size these aren't capable of more than 1A or so, preferably much less. The `neopixel-controller` files are for a standalone controller board. `cassowari-original.sch` is a reverse-engineered schematic from the perfboard power LED controller from the original [RoboJackets](https://robojackets.org) [Cassowari](https://wiki.robojackets.org/Cassowari) robot. The `cassowarii-controller` files are for the new Cassowarii robot's power LED controller.
